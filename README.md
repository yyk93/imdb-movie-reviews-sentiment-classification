### Sentiment Classification with IMDB Movie Reviews

#### Background:
IMDb contains a database about movies, television shows and videos, games and content streams online which includes data on the content itself like the casts, production crew, plot synopsis and reviews. Such reviews can allow prospective viewers to understand from the crowd whether is the content worth viewing, while the production crew can also get feedbacks on their films. Such reviews could also allow marketplace to better promote the films to consumers who are likely to share the same sentiment as the reviewers - if its a positive sentiment, recommend it to the individual; else, not recommend it. Thus it would be useful to build a model to classify the overall sentiments of the movie based on their reviews collected before further expanding it to match consumers'sentiment.

#### Dataset

The dataset consists of film reviews from IMDB.

#### Task: 
Build a neural network in classifying text sentiments of movie reviews, to assess a movieâ€™s performance with the audience

#### Results and Analysis:
The model has achieved a 87.068% accuracy.

#### Future Works:
To include consumers' past history of their sentiments of similar and different genres of films and to do a recommendation system to recommend films to the consumers
